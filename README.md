## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### API Issues
If you encounter API validation issues:
1. Verify your Gemini API key in the `.env` file
2. Ensure the API key is properly formatted (no quotes or spaces)
3. Check your API quota and permissions
4. The application uses 'gemini-1.5-flash' model which may have different availability than other models
5. Review browser console (F12) for detailed error messages

### Demo Mode
The application will automatically fall back to demo mode if:
- No API key is provided
- The API key is invalid or expired
- You've exceeded your API quota

In demo mode, responses are pre-defined rather than generated by AI.
